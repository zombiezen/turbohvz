Humans vs. Zombies, created by Brad Sappington and Chris Weed, is a game of
moderated tag commonly played on college campuses. A group of human players
attempts to survive a "zombie outbreak" by not being tagged by a growing group
of zombie players.

This is a TurboGears <http://www.turbogears.org> web application to manage a
game of Humans vs. Zombies.  It can be started by running the start-turbohvz.py
script.
